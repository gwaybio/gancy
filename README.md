Image-based profiling can be used to detect mechanism of action (MOA) of small molecules.
Here, we use single cell data from [Breinig et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20156400) to classify MOA for each single cell.

Traditionally, MOAs are predicted based on well-aggregated profiles.
Here, we attempt to classify MOA of each individual single cell.
